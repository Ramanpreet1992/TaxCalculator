  Validations were made-
  
  1).To ensure that the user only enters a number.
  
  2).To restrict multiple clicks when the data is loading.
  
  Once the user enters the salary, the API fetches the proper data. If the applicable data is fetched without any error, following data is displayed.
   
   1).Effective rate
   
   2).Tax Brackets, Tax Owed as pe the Tax Rates and Tax Owed.
